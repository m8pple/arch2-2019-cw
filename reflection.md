Guidance
--------

The aim is to get you to think about specific things that you
have learnt, or things that went well or less well. For each
of the areas identified below, write (at most) 100 words on how
well that area went. Examples of things that you might address
are:

- Some kind of concept or approach that became clearer

- A skill or tool that you found useful

- Identifying where some choices were poor

- A change in approach that improved your solution

- Changes in strategy that could help in future projects

You may find it difficult to capture things in 100 words,
and this is part of the challenge - communication is
an important part of engineering, and it is important to
be able to condense and summarise things. If a section
is more than 100 words, then the result will be linearly
scaled such that at 200 words or more the mark drops to zero.

You should identify things specific to you and this coursework,
not just general things, and link them to specific features or
activities of the coursework. In some cases you may want to refer
to classes, functions, or source files in your submission,
and/or highlight specific commits (e.g. by hash) in order to
show changes.

For example, these are quite generic and don't tell us anything:

> I learnt how to use classes more effectively.

> I hadn't used the command line much before, and now have got used to it.

Whereas these are more specific (don't use these as a template, you
have to use your own words):

> Originally I wasn't sure how to map part A of the simulator into
> structs, so I originally thought about mapping each B to an
> struct. However, this turned out to be the wrong approach
> because C, so we ended up using D.

> I suggested that we use method A to build the testbench, as I
> thought it would have benefit B. While it worked well enough,
> in future I might choose to do C, because D. 

There is no "right" answer, and there is no particular
requirement on how "big" each thing is, either in concept
size or the number of words. There is also no bias towards
whether a strength or weakness is better - either could be
relevant. The only requirements are that the answers should be:

- Specific to you

- Specific to this coursework

- Be some sort of genuine reflection on your practise

- Related to the specific topic

This will be assessed, and is not just a tick box exercise.
